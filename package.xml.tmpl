  <summary>CMS featuring in-context editing, version control, custom slots as Symfony modules</summary>
  <description>
Apostrophe is a Symfony and Doctrine-based CMS that emphasizes in-context editing. All slot types are implemented as Symfony modules, with all the flexibility that implies. Version control is implemented, permitting easy rollback of all edits. jQuery is used to implement AJAX features.

      <notes> * Support classes for functional tests of Apostrophe. Our functional test parent classes permit fast reloading of the database between functional test classes via mysqldump. Support hooks for this are documented, we'll release that portion of our internal commit tool at some point. 
 * Language switcher no longer uses a-controls class, I created a separate CSS class for it to avoid breaking functional tests that check whether the user sees controls they shouldn't.
 * changed background position for buttons to be compatible with the gradients, fixed incorrect width on slideshow arrows
 * Merged further improvements to functional testing from trunk
 * merged new add slot user interface into the 1.3 branch
 * removed the old tabs component in favor of the new aNavigation component we want people to use
 * "Home" no longer appears in French when it should be English
 * Related: aPageTable::retrieveBySlug() now fetches the page complete with its current slots for the proper culture. Without this there were too many situations where Doctrine's standard policy of refreshing a particular object if it is requested more than once led to unexpected behavior, such as missing slots or the wrong versions or cultures of slots.
 * missing alt images
 * restored button positioning for singleton slots
 * CSS improvements
 * fixed icon images for trash and cancel
 * Warning caused by obsolete argument in removeAttributes call fixed
 * When a-area slot is in an add-slot-now state, the z-index is increased to 999 so that the menu sits on top of everything else. This helps with stacking and overlap for neighboring elements
 * If you click anywhere outside of the addslot dropdown the dropdown goes away
 * There is no Form helper in Symfony 1.4 (this affected the aSubCrud functionality which is fairly obscure)
 * Submit and cancel butotn look and feel fixes
 * updated slideshow controls in template and css
 * No text shadow on new add-slot dropdown lis, up &amp; down slot arrows were the wrong width.
 * Fixed double-escaping in rename page form
 * changed padding on flagged button, was set for previous button dimensions
 * Fixed an ugly bug with History Previews in 1.3
 * fixed slideshow arrow background position
 * styled blog error messages
 * little styling change on the blog errors
  * HTML "button" elements eradicated
 * solved the annoying cancel button issue finally, removed the stray lines from aUI that didn't need to be there anymore, and renamed some special button classes to avoid conflicts and clarify
 * Took the class off of the slideshow arrows because they're not buttons
 * Our admin generator theme no longer mandates that i18n be turned on in your settings.yml (although it CAN be)
 * added a unique class name to aNavigation for tabs and accordions
 * added a unique class name to aNavigation for breadcrumbs too

         * Cancel works properly again in the media plugin
         * Media plugin also clears stale selection attributes when starting a new selection

         * Plain text slots are now i18n-correct (UTF8).
         * Harmless but large extra tarballs of older releases no longer in plugin tarball
         * Button CSS more cross-browser compatible

      <notes>
         * A computer abandoned by an admin who has logged out can no longer be used to edit slots the admin previously edited using cleverly constructed URLs (only an issue on the same computer and if the PHP session has not ended). Note that you must upgrade your myUser class in apps/frontend/lib to extend aSecurityUser rather than sfGuardSecurityUser to get this fix (aSecurityUser is a subclass of the latter)
         * Global or virtual-page media slots can be edited successfully on Symfony pages that are not CMS pages
         * Unpublished pages no longer interfere with aNavigationAccordion layout
         * Fixtures no longer use HTML tags our filters remove on edit
         * Plaintext slots now autolink URLs and email address (obfuscated) as described in the manual
         * Search engine updates refactored, search engine now updates when you save page settings
         * 'tool' option to rich text slots now correctly activates the FCK toolbar set name you specify
         * Slot save/cancel buttons now survive form validation passes properly (thanks to Spike)
         * Date widget is XHTML correct (thanks Spike)
         * Engines now work when the CMS is not mounted at the root of the site (important for those using the CMS as a subfolder of a site dominated by other Symfony modules)
         * Attempting to attach a list of zero items to a slideshow no longer results in adding all items in the media repository
         * Cross-browser and XHTML strictness fixes
         * Moved lib/base to lib/action (you must symfony cc)
         * Lost connections between existing media slots and media items when editing other media slots: fixed. Also, slideshows etc. are no longer removed on "cancel," and selecting zero media items no longer selects all media items
         * i18n of over 99% of the admin interface (many thanks to Quentin, Galileo, Frank, Pablo and Fotis), new languages are regularly being added to the demo project's apps/frontend/i18n folder
         * More convenient i18n of your site content (temporary titles supplied, all navigation controls work for pages whose titles are not yet translated)
         * Aesthetic upgrades
         * Superadmins can grant superadmin status
         * Some demo-specific styles moved from a.css to demo.css
         * Optional language selector in a/login partial
         * Global admin buttons now have separate names and labels (labels can be internationalized) and a documented way to add and reorder them in app.yml
         * Alpha channel is now preserved when rendering PNGs from a PNG original with gd (not available with netpbm)
         * Compact PDF slot style, without inline preview (you can override this in aMediaPDF/normalView if you want it back and you have ghostscript)
         * Better IE6 upgrade message
         * Various private methods now protected for easier app level overrides

      <notes>Removed obsolete default layout for media repository; those not using the sandbox no longer have to explicitly override use_bundled_layout. Removed obsolete CSS files not used since the pk days. Media library cancel button is easier to see. Slideshows are saved in a way that doesn't crush additional data application-level overrides might be saving. All components and actions classes now overridable and inheritable at the app level. "Download original" and PDf viewing links now work properly.</notes>

      <notes>Documented slot variants. Fixed bugs in slot variants. Variants no longer have to rigorously contradict each other, they always start from the slot's options. Added the allowed_variants option for slots and areas, which allows them to be restricted to those that are suitable to a particular context, and also reordered, changing the default if desired (the first one allowed is the default). Removed 'mkdir -p' call that made generate-slot-type unusable on Windows. Various CSS fixes.</notes>
